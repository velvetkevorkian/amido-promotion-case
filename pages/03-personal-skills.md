### Teamwork

On a large project with lots of moving parts and a complex set of environments like Next EPM it was vital to coordinate efforts across the team, and I built excellent relationships with team members across the project to make sure we were working effectively.

### Documentation

Part of the Redux implementation for FedMod was documenting both the high level architecture, and a lower level step-by-step approach for developers to follow when adding a new MFE to the project.

### Prioritisation

On every project I work with DMs/BAs/tech leads to understand team priorities, and make sure our work aligns to that.

### Continuous Learning/Improvement and Knowledge Sharing

Because EPM has so many moving parts, sharing knowledge with the team is vital. I try and keep an eye on the team chat so that no-one gets blocked by something I can help with, and pay attention to what other people are working on to try and point people in the right direction where possible.

I participated in the Node.js training course and am hoping to do the exam; I also have courses on web accessibility and three.js which I'm working through in my spare time.
