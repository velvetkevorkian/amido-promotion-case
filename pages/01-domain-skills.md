### Transfers business requirements into design and architecture sub-systems as part of the technical implementation

On the Federated Modules framework project, I helped design and implement the Redux implementation, which shared state between federated MFEs and combined them into a single server-rendered page.

For Next Product, I was part of the team translating high-level ADRs into a shared framework. We optimised for modularity, and easy maintenance.

On my current EPM stint, I've implemented configurable templating into one of the PLP MFEs, which is a key feature Next's BAU product teams have been requesting.

### Builds sub-systems and renders across a mixture of CSR and SSR

Both Next EPM and the Federated Modules project use server-side rendering with client-side hydration. EPM has several complex client side features I worked on, such as infinite scroll, filtering, and the image slider the PLP tiles are built around.

Next Product was a set of client-side micro-frontends.

### Works on large sized projects with multiple teams collaborating together with APIs outside of the NodeJS back end

Both Next projects involved dealing with the Next BE team to clarify expected behaviour and flag bugs with their enormously complicated product database. On the Product programme we worked closely with a BE team in Poland, and developed a close working relationship as they built out the APIs.

### Measures the quality of responsive design, accessibility, mobile first development

Many of the bugs that my first EPM team was responsible for fixing were accessiblity issues raised by an independent audit, so every fix was tested with accessibility in mind.

### Implements a back end for front end

Both EPM and Federated Modules use bespoke Node/Express based BFFs with a variety of complex middleware.

### Writes appropriate end-to-end testing

Next EPM has an extensive e2e test suite which I had to amend on occasion, e.g. when the header team enabled a feature that broke a large number of PLP tests I took the initiative to diagnose and fix the problem and unblock releases.

### Accountable for code and engineering quality across the sub-systems and provides solutions in line with the client's requirement within the Amido standards

I've been an active participant in code review, and have suggested improvements to make the code simpler and more expressive. 

### Collaborates with creative and UX designers and decides what appropriate components should be build in the design system

I spent time discussing with our team's UX contact when issues arose because designs hadn't accounted for some scenarios, and presented options for addressing them within the constraints of the EPM project.

I translated Rob P's Next Product design system into a Material UI theme to be used across the suite of MFEs

### Articulates the purpose of chosen solutions using the most appropriate tools and frameworks of sub-systems

I had to communicate EPM's complex architecture, both within the team to help other devs, and to external stakeholders, e.g. the performance team who wanted to understand how and why a change we made might affect their measurements.

### Builds deployment and integration tools in collaboration with DevOps

I worked with DevOps on Next Product to refine the build pipelines, to ensure we weren't running unnecessary builds. 

### Understands architectural concepts of Connected Services, Data Engineering, DevOps and QA

I worked closely with both Amido and Next QAs to ensure both manual and automated testing weren't affected by changes, and worked with BE to identify how APIs were generating unexpected data on the FE

### Appreciates and designs service solutions with wider competency domains, such as Connected Services

I participated in modelling sessions for Next Product with the BE team where we collaborated on the API spec for the project.
