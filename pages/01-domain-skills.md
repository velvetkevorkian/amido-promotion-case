## Domain Skills

### Transfers business requirements into design and architecture sub-systems as part of the technical implementation

FedMod - Redux implementation
Renaming everything in prodsumm state
Next Product - translating high-level ADRs into a shared framework

### Builds sub-systems and renders across a mixture of CSR and SSR

Both Next EPM and the Federated Modules project use SSR with client-side hydration. EPM had several complex client side features I worked on (infinite scroll, filtering).

Next Product was a set of client-side apps

### Works on large sized projects with multiple teams collaborating together with APIs outside of the NodeJS back end

Next EPM involved dealing with the Next BE team to clarify expected behaviour and flag bugs with their enormously complicated product database.

Next Product featured a number of teams 

### Measures the quality of responsive design, accessibility, mobile first development

Many of the bugs that my EPM team was responsible for fixing were accessiblity issues raised by an independent audit, so every fix was tested with accessibility in mind.

### Implements a back end for front end

Both EPM and FedMod use bespoke Node/Express based BFFs with a variety of complex middleware.

### Writes appropriate end-to-end testing

Next EPM has an extensive e2e test suite which I had to amend on occasion, e.g. when the header team enabled a feature that broke a large number of PLP tests I took the initiative to diagnose and fix the problem and unblock releases.

### Accountable for code and engineering quality across the sub-systems and provides solutions in line with the client's requirement within the Amido standards

Throughout my time at Amido I've been an active participant in code review, and have suggested improvements to make the code simpler and more expressive.

### Collaborates with creative and UX designers and decides what appropriate components should be build in the design system

I spent time discussing with our team's UX contact when issues arose because designs hadn't accounted for some scenarios, and presented options for addressing them within the constraints of the EPM project.

### Articulates the purpose of chosen solutions using the most appropriate tools and frameworks of sub-systems

Although I wasn't responsible for the architectural choices made in the EPM project, I did have to communicate them both within the team to help other devs, and to external stakeholders, e.g. the perf team who wanted to understand how and why a change we made might affect their measurements.

- Builds multiple CSS frameworks

- Identifies future standards such as ES7, CSS4

### Builds deployment and integration tools in collaboration with DevOps

I identified an issue with Lighthouse reporting in the EPM pipeline, and worked with Rhys to resolve it. I also helped identify some issues when we migrated the PLP to the EPM monorepo.

### Understands architectural concepts of Connected Services, Data Engineering, DevOps and QA

Worked closely with QAs to ensure both manual and automated testing weren't affected by changes, and worked with BE to identify how the APIs were generating unexpected data on the FE

### Appreciates and designs service solutions with wider competency domains, such as Connected Services
