## Leadership Skills

### Coaching

While working on Federated Modules I helped onboard Paul S, and worked with him to get up to speed on how we were implementing Redux into the project, which we tackled successfully together. On EPM, I became the de-facto expert on certain topics (fonts, currency formatting) and spent time working with other members of the team to support them when they were working in those areas.

### Risk

On the EPM bugs team, it was important to balance fixing bugs against the potential of introducing new issues, and judge the risk/reward of issues that seemed minor but were not straightforward to fix.

### Ownership

On EPM, I became the go-to person for certain types of bugs, and also took ownership of issues that seemed simple but required a deeper approach (e.g. refactoring the product summary slider implementation). On FedMod I led the Redux implementation from architecture to implementation, and guided other devs working on it.

### Influencing

I've been involved in discussions about what solutions to use as we develop the tech stack for Next Product. I also presented a range of solutions for design issues to the UX stakeholder on EPM, rather than letting them go away and come back with something that would cause more work.
