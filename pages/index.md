## Intro

I've been an Interfaces & Devices consultant since November 2021. Since then, I've worked on:
1. the Next EPM programme, as part of the bugs team
2. Alessio's Federated Modules/SSR framework project
3. Next's Product Transformation programme
4. Next EPM again, on the Front-end Architecture/Framework team

In that time, I've received excellent feedback from both Next and Amido developers suggesting that I have performed at a senior level.
